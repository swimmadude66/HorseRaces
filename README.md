Horse Races
	A day at the races
	
	This is a popular drinking game using only a deck of cards and (until now) the honor system. The rules of the game are as follows:
	
	1: The ace of each suit is to be set aside, face up. These are your "horses"
	2: 8 more cards (or however many you please) are to be placed next to eachother, face down
	3: the remainder of the deck is set aside until race time
	4: Players bet on a suit to cross all 8 cards first. Bets can be sips, shots, cash, whatever.
	5: Once all bets are made, the Jockey (dealer) flips cards off the deck, moving the corresponding suit's horse forward.
	6: if all of the horses have passed a side card, that card gets flipped, and the matching horse is moved backwards.
	
	The Program handles the nitty-gritty of moving horses, so the basics of it are to place your bets, and hit "Race"
	
	If playing with drinks, the traditional way to handle them is to drink what you bet if you lose, or give out what you won.
	
	Drink responsibly, play hard, and share with your friends.
